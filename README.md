This is the code for the MARS avionics. 
Other repos that go along with this are:
[gps_test](https://github.com/zeulewan/gps_test), [imu_test](https://github.com/zeulewan/imu_test), [antennachannel](https://github.com/zeulewan/antennachannel) [gtroundstation](https://github.com/zeulewan/groundstation). There is no code for testing just the barometer currently.
